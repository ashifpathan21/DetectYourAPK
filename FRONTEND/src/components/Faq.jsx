    question: "Is my uploaded APK private?",
    answer:
      "Yes, your privacy is our top priority. All uploaded files are encrypted in transit and at rest. Files are automatically deleted after analysis. We never store, share, or analyze your APK files beyond the security scan.",

    question: "Can I scan APK files from any source?",

    question: "What type of threats can SecureAPK detect?",
    answer:
      "SecureAPK goes beyond basic malware detection. It identifies banking trojans, spyware, adware, rootkits, fake and malicious apps, as well as suspicious permissions and obfuscation techniques. Our system also uses SHA-256 integrity checks, permission risk analysis, and reviewâ€“rating correlation to flag potentially harmful apps. Additionally, SecureAPK runs apps in a controlled sandbox environment to analyze runtime behavior, ensuring a holistic and reliable mobile threat detection process.",
